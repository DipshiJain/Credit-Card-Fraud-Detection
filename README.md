Nowadays there are many frauds happening in credit card companies and it is important for credit card companies to be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.
The objective of the project is to detect is a transaction is normal or fraud. I have performed Logistic regression for obtaining the objective. I have performed different data visualization techniques to understand the insight of the data.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle here.

I have done coding in python notebook. There are many modules of python such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit learn, Seaborn, Cufflinks that should be downloaded using pip install before running the code.
